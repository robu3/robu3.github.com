			<div class="post-body"><p>Let me preface this personal account by stating that everything included herein has been written down exactly as I remember it; I honestly cannot say how much of it is <em>real</em> and how much of it occurred only in my mind, as my mind has been through a lot as of late and is beginning show some cracks.</p>

<p>I live in a smaller, 1940s-era rental house in the Richmond, Virginia area. Coming from Seattle, I was amazed at how much house you can get for money, compared to what you can get in Seattle. The only real negative that I have noticed so far is the bugs: between mosquitoes, ticks, and (worst of all) cockroaches, Richmond is full of them. Rental houses seems to be a safehaven for roaches; everyone I have lived in since I moved here has been infested. This is the first time I have ever had to deal with pest issues, as Seattle seems to be much less buggier than the RVA. Unfortunately, the house I live in currently appears to be some sort of nexus of cockroach activity.</p>

<p>Being a relatively DIY sort of fellow, I decided initially to attempt to resolve the cockroach problem on my own, purchasing eco-friendly and non-toxic bug spray (since I have two young boys) and bait traps from Home Depot. My efforts appeared to have little effect. The type of cockroach infesting my home is of the American variety, not the smaller German, and this line appears to be particularly resilient to common poisons.</p></div>
