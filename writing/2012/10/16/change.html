<p><em>Change</em> - such a complicated thing to come to grips with. We go through our lives, oftentimes repeating nearly the exact same tasks day in and day out, five days a week. This sort of repetition is comforting in an odd way; we are able to plan around it, improve our efficiency in carrying out these repetitive tasks, even perfect their execution. There is comfort in consistency, in knowing generally what each day will bring, but there is also boredom and indifference towards the tasks which we have become scarily proficient in carrying out.</p>

<p>I recently reached a point at my current place of employment where these feelings of boredom and indifference have begun to set in. The company is small, and there is much talk of new opportunities and growth, of making new products and going after new markets, but when it comes time to commit resources to these new ideas, the motivation that seemed so present in the words spoken by management disappear like the breath on which they rode. This has a demoralizing effect on the voices that are pushing for change (such as myself), since we share thirty, forty minutes, even an hour, of collaborative brainstorming and pure creativity, only for us proponents of change to be completely dismissed later when it comes time to discuss resource (i.e. time) allotment; it is almost as if the previous conversations never happened.</p>

<p>I have spent over a year here attempting to effect change at this company, and to be blunt, I failed. Whether that is due to my own shortcomings (I do have a tendency to be somewhat indirect and non-confrontational) or the company&#8217;s collective lack of real interest in changing, I am unsure. I do know, however, that I am in dire need of some change: if I have to go another day of being forced to work in the same confined space, on the same repetitive tasks, I may just lose it; handing in my two week&#8217;s notice and then immediately walking out while <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M83_(band'>M83</a>) is playing in the background is a real possibility.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I am having such a hard time deciding whether or not I want to stay here is that I initially had really high hopes for this company; I could feel the CEO&#8217;s excitement about what we do and where we were headed. Unfortunately, we never ended up truly heading in that direction, and my appeals to management for their support in getting more help to lift these new ideas off the ground fell on deaf ears. I am sad to say my passion for my job and for this company has slowly been replaced by apathy; like the little pot of basil I left on my back porch during the heat of summer and forgot to water, my passion has wilted and left only its dry, withered remains. One of my favorite quotes goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opposite of love is not hate, it&#8217;s indifference. The opposite of beauty is not ugliness, it&#8217;s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it&#8217;s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, but indifference between life and death. - Elie Wiesel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My job dissatisfaction went through phases, starting initially with excitement and passion, giving way to frustration and anger (hate is a bit strong), and finally lapsing into indifference and apathy. In other words, I am now at the exact opposite pole from where I started, as the opposite of love is indifference. Indifference is an empty feeling and much harder to deal with than hate. Going to work a hollow shell is so much more difficult than merely hating your job; anger and hate can be a powerful motivating force and catalyst for change, while apathy simply crushes the soul.</p>

<p>That is why I decided it is time for a change; I need it for my own personal well being. Change is not necessarily scary, neither is it inherently good or bad; I find change to be liberating in almost every case where I have encountered it. Also, change is no stranger to me; I drove across America with all my worldly possessions packed in the back of a Hyundai Accent just two years ago, to try my luck out here on the East Coast. As of late, I have gotten a bit too comfortable with my routine and thus was initially put off by thought of change; in the course of writing this post, I came to remember why I always end up appreciating it.</p>

<p>Turning in my resignation immediately would be the most direct way of creating the change I seek; it would also jeopardize my team&#8217;s ability to finish the current run of projects. Therefore, I have decided to do something I have never done before: speak to management directly about my grievances and feelings of indifference. I can honestly say that I like every single one of my coworkers as a person, and I want to give this company one more chance to embrace the new ideas and new technology it needs to be successful. If this final plea goes unheeded, then it will be time to turn on some M83.</p>
