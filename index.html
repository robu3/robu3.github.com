			<h3 class="title">Change</h3>
			<h3 class="date">2012-10-16</h3>

		</div>
		<div class="post-body"><p><em>Change</em> - such a complicated thing to come to grips with. We go through our lives, oftentimes repeating nearly the exact same tasks day in and day out, five days a week. This sort of repetition is comforting in an odd way; we are able to plan around it, improve our efficiency in carrying out these repetitive tasks, even perfect their execution. There is comfort in consistency, in knowing generally what each day will bring, but there is also boredom and indifference towards the tasks which we have become scarily proficient in carrying out.</p>

<p>I recently reached a point at my current place of employment where these feelings of boredom and indifference have begun to set in. The company is small, and there is much talk of new opportunities and growth, of making new products and going after new markets, but when it comes time to commit resources to these new ideas, the motivation that seemed so present in the words spoken by management disappear like the breath on which they rode. This has a demoralizing effect on the voices that are pushing for change (such as myself), since we share thirty, forty minutes, even an hour, of collaborative brainstorming and pure creativity, only for us proponents of change to be completely dismissed later when it comes time to discuss resource (i.e. time) allotment; it is almost as if the previous conversations never happened.</p>

<p>I have spent over a year here attempting to effect change at this company, and to be blunt, I failed. Whether that is due to my own shortcomings (I do have a tendency to be somewhat indirect and non-confrontational) or the company&#8217;s collective lack of real interest in changing, I am unsure. I do know, however, that I am in dire need of some change: if I have to go another day of being forced to work in the same confined space, on the same repetitive tasks, I may just lose it; handing in my two week&#8217;s notice and then immediately walking out while <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M83_(band'>M83</a>) is playing in the background is a real possibility.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I am having such a hard time deciding whether or not I want to stay here is that I initially had really high hopes for this company; I could feel the CEO&#8217;s excitement about what we do and where we were headed. Unfortunately, we never ended up truly heading in that direction, and my appeals to management for their support in getting more help to lift these new ideas off the ground fell on deaf ears. I am sad to say my passion for my job and for this company has slowly been replaced by apathy; like the little pot of basil I left on my back porch during the heat of summer and forgot to water, my passion has wilted and left only its dry, withered remains. One of my favorite quotes goes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The opposite of love is not hate, it&#8217;s indifference. The opposite of beauty is not ugliness, it&#8217;s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, it&#8217;s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, but indifference between life and death. - Elie Wiesel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My job dissatisfaction went through phases, starting initially with excitement and passion, giving way to frustration and anger (hate is a bit strong), and finally lapsing into indifference and apathy. In other words, I am now at the exact opposite pole from where I started, as the opposite of love is indifference. Indifference is an empty feeling and much harder to deal with than hate. Going to work a hollow shell is so much more difficult than merely hating your job; anger and hate can be a powerful motivating force and catalyst for change, while apathy simply crushes the soul.</p>

<p>That is why I decided it is time for a change; I need it for my own personal well being. Change is not necessarily scary, neither is it inherently good or bad; I find change to be liberating in almost every case where I have encountered it. Also, change is no stranger to me; I drove across America with all my worldly possessions packed in the back of a Hyundai Accent just two years ago, to try my luck out here on the East Coast. As of late, I have gotten a bit too comfortable with my routine and thus was initially put off by thought of change; in the course of writing this post, I came to remember why I always end up appreciating it.</p>

<p>Turning in my resignation immediately would be the most direct way of creating the change I seek; it would also jeopardize my team&#8217;s ability to finish the current run of projects. Therefore, I have decided to do something I have never done before: speak to management directly about my grievances and feelings of indifference. I can honestly say that I like every single one of my coworkers as a person, and I want to give this company one more chance to embrace the new ideas and new technology it needs to be successful. If this final plea goes unheeded, then it will be time to turn on some M83.</p></div>

		<div class="post-body"><p>I decided to finally start a blog, not because I like the sound of my own voice (does that expression even apply when referring to written words?), but because I want a place to record my progress on various projects and endeavors. Public exposure adds additional pressure to bring projects to completion, and bringing projects to completion is something I need to work on. Also, it would warm my heart to know that at least one other programmer learned something of use from my posts.</p>

<p>Being a developer, it simply wasn&#8217;t enough for me to setup a Tumblr account or use some other pre-packaged solution; of course, I had to go off and roll my own. After a little research, I decided to go with Jekyll for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s file-based, meaning I can write posts anywhere on any machine</li>

<li>It&#8217;s Ruby-based and I wanted to brush up on my Ruby skills</li>

<li>It&#8217;s an established project with a wealth of resources available</li>
</ul>

<p>Ruhoh also looks like a promising project, but I wanted to start with the granddaddy of static blogging before moving onto the next generation :)</p>

<p>Since I just purchased my first <a href='http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro'>MacBook Pro</a> (15&#8221; w/ Retina Display), I was starting from a completely blank slate. For any fellow Ruby novices out there, there are 3 steps to getting started working with a Ruby library on a virgin machine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href='https://rvm.io'>RVM</a> (RVM is a tool used to manage multiple Ruby environments; essential when working codebases that utilize different versions of Ruby or gems)</li>

<li>Install RubyGems (Ruby package manager; not necessary for Ruby 1.9+, and for &lt; 1.9, RVM takes care of it for you)</li>

<li>Install the gem for the library you want to use</li>
</ol>

<p>The steps basically end up looking like the following in your terminal:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
rvm 1.9.3
gem install jekyll
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The first command installs RVM and the latest stable version of Ruby (which includes RubyGems), thus taking care of #1 and #2. The second tells RVM which version of Ruby to use; you can leave this out and it will use whichever version is set to default. The third command installs the gem for the library, in this case, Jekyll. Note that you may need to open a new terminal window after installing RVM to get the commands recognized.</p>

<p>Ok, now back to Jekyll. Overall, the setup has been pretty painless so far (granted, I haven&#8217;t tried to do anything fancy yet). The only custom code that I had to add (not even write!) was for the category index pages, which was already provided by the Jekyll team in the form of the <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Plugins'>CategoryPageGenerator</a>. Also, since I opted to use Sass instead of straight CSS, I added a small rakefile to streamline my local development process. The rakefile compiles the Sass into CSS, sets the configuration file for test or production, and also pulls in posts from my Dropbox folder, just in case I build up a queue in there. Below is my rakefile in its entirety:</p>

<p>I have to admit, I totally undervalued Rake until I went to setup this blog, probably due to my ignorance; it makes building terminal tools a breeze. Until now, I&#8217;ve always just cobbled together various Ruby scripts to accomplish a task, and Rake provides a nice structure to organize that kind of scripting with.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, setting up this blog has been a valuable learning experience, and I highly recommend doing the same to anyone who wants learn a little Ruby. There&#8217;s still a lot to learn, but definitely <em>ruby_skill++</em>;</p></div>
